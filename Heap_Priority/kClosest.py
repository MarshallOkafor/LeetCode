This is the solution to LeetCode problem 973: 

Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, 
return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0). The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean 
distance (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2). You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be 
unique (except for the order that it is in).
