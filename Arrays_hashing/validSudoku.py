"""
This is solution to LeetCode problem 36.

Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according 
to the following rules:

Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.

Runtime: O(9 ^ 2)
